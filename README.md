# Cura-profiles
My main cura profiles (settings)

## Most commonly changed settings
- Toggling support on/off
- Changing layer height between 0.2 and 0.22 and 0.25 as desired
- Wall count, 2-4 based on strength required. Notice alternating extra wall is usually on, as is connect infill lines
- reducing ironing spacing for smoother tops
- Very occasionally switch to a 3D infill e.g. cubic subdivision if forces might come from weird angles
